# 🌟 Exercise 4 : Floats

#1- An integrer is a whole number where as a float is a floating point number. It is a number with a decimal point. You need more memory to store a float than and integer. For both you can use math functions.

#2- To create a sequence of floats you can use a list or a tuple. You can use range and loops together.

#3
list = range(3, 11)
#this creates a list with a range of numbers from the 3rd index to the 11th index
number = [x /2 for x in list]
# number is equal to half of the value of the index
# example:
# index 3 /2 = 1.5
# index 4 /2 = 2
# index 5 /2 = 2.5
# This continues to index 11 /2 = 5.5

print(number)


# 🌟 Exercise 5 : For loops
#1
for x in range(1, 21) :
    print(x)

#2
numbers = range(1, 21)
for num in numbers :
    if num %2 == 0 :
        print(num)
