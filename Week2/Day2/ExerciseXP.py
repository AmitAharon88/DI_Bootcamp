# ğŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Floats

#1- An integrer is a whole number where as a float is a floating point number. It is a number with a decimal point. You need more memory to store a float than and integer. For both you can use math functions.

#2- To create a sequence of floats you can use a list or a tuple. You can use range and loops together.

#3
